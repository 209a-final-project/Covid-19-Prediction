"Notes"
"For purposes of this table, states were included if they required insurers to take the listed actions. A number of states released guidance or recommendations for insurers to take the actions listed in this table but fell short of issuing a requirement and are thus not included."
""
"* The Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires all group health plans and individual health insurance policies to cover testing and associated visits related to the diagnosis of COVID-19 with no cost sharing and prohibits them from imposing prior authorization requirements on these services during the federally declared emergency period. Federal law supersedes any state requirements."
""
"See [here](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/paid-family-and-sick-leave/) for more detailed information on paid sick leave policies."


Footnotes
"1. AL requires a premium nonpayment grace period in wake of Hurricane Sally, but not explicitly for those impacted by COVID-19."
"2. Both DC and NM are requiring insurers to waive cost-sharing for treatment of non-COVID respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and influenza."
"3. DC's special enrollment period was not adopted in response to coronavirus, but is open to a broad group of people, including those who are uninsured."
"4. MD's premium nonpayment grace period requirement for individual policies was clarified on 8/11 to only be waived if the emergency coronavirus special enrollment period for the MHBE is in effect and if the carrier provides notice that the individual can enroll in coverage through this special enrollment period."
"5. While NY has not explicitly waived prior authorization requirements for COVID-19 treatment, the state has directed insurers to suspend prior authorization for all outpatient services delivered at hospitals, which could include services related to COVID-19."
"6. OK requires a premium nonpayment grace period extension for all health insurance policies and prohibits insurers from canceling coverage for anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 and unable to return to work or maintain coverage due to COVID-19."
