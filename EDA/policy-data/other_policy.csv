"Notes"
"A number of states have issued guidance to nursing facilities and assisted living facilities intended to limit residents' exposure to COVID-19.  These requirements include prohibiting visitors to facilities except for end-of-life situations, performing daily staff screening for illness, and universal use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by facility staff.  Information presented here reflect state guidance issued as of June 1, 2020."
""
"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has released [guidance](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/4220-covid-19-long-term-care-facility-guidance.pdf) for nursing homes, including a prohibition on visitors and non-essential staff, daily screening of staff for fever and respiratory symptoms, and requirements for use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by health care staff. The CMS guidance applies specifically to nursing facilities that fall under federal regulatory purview, leaving it to states to establish standards for assisted living facilities (ALFs) and other congregate living facilities."
