"Notes"
"For purposes of this table, states were included if they took executive action to require private insurers to take the listed actions. A number of states released guidance or recommendations for insurers to take the actions listed in this table but fell short of issuing a requirement and are thus not included. Please see table footnotes for more information on the consideration of state laws."

"*New Requirements for Coverage of Telehealth Services*: refers to executive actions that states have taken in response to the coronavirus pandemic to require that insurers cover additional services via telehealth."
""
"*Reimbursement Parity for Telehealth and In-Person Services*: refers to state requirements that insurers reimburse providers for telehealth services at the same rate as in-person services. "
""
"*Require Expanded Options for Delivery of Telehealth Services*: refers to state actions that allow for additional modes of delivering telehealth services (e.g., audio-only) or eliminate barriers to access to telehealth services (e.g., regulations requiring prior patient-provider relationship)."
