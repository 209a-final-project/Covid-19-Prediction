Hi, 
Thank you for grading our project. Please run the jupyternotebooks according to the specified steps. Otherwise, you may run into errors. To reduce the size of our zipfile, we only include data that we manually downloaded in the data folder.For other datasets, please run through the notebooks to get them. 

In addition, our presentation could be found via this link. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMVhSDN7_14&feature=youtu.be

We would appreciate any feedback from you. Have a nice holiday!
